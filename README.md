# LeetCode-Subsets
Just implemented a random iterative algo that I find interesting and really like!
Subsets is a LeetCode problem where you return a list of all subsets of an set of integers, i.e. given an input of {1, 2, 3}, the program should return all the subsets from{}, {1}, {1,2}...to {1,2,3}
